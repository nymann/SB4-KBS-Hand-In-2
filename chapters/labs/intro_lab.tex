\section{Intro Lab}
By visiting \link{https://github.com/nymann/IntroLab} you can see a gif demo of what
the game looks like at this stage in the \texttt{README.md} file.

See \ref{design-lab} for an analysis of dependencies and possible design
changes.

\subsection{Implemented features}
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Added Enemy ship that moves randomly and shoots bullets
        \item Bullets will automatically be removed when outside the screen area.
        \item Naive weapon cooldown\: (you can only shoot if there's less than $n$ bullets on screen)
        \item Colored enemy ship, player ship and bullets.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Running the game}
\begin{minted}{sh}
# Via make target

# Via maven
