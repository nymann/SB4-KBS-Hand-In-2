\section{NetBeans Lab 1}

In this lab we transitioned away from registering our service provider
implementations via files in \texttt{resources/META-INF}. To instead use the
ServiceProvider annotation:

\inputminted{java}{code/openide-service-provider.java}

This change of how to registering a service provider implementation alone is
very welcome. It gives our language servers a fighting chance to see what's
going on, and makes the code much more clear for new developers. On top of that
we no longer need our service transformer described in \ref{java-lab:uberjar}

\subsection{Running the game}
\begin{minted}{sh}
# Via make target
make run

# Via maven
mvn install -DskipTests -f Asteroids/pom.xml
mvn nbm:run-platform -f Asteroids/application/pom.xml
\end{minted}
