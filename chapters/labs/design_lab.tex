In this lab I took a look at the Intro lab and Java lab, and did a dependency
analysis, where I also talk about possible solutions to the described problems.

It would also have been interesting to look at the differences between the Game
Lab and Java Lab here, to really drive home the point of \texttt{SPI}.
