\subsection{Running the game}

\subsection{Color Value fix}
The third party libgdx library we were using had a breaking change in regards
it's function \texttt{Color\.valueOf} which I was using to transform a hex color
into a libgdx Color. In my previous labs I was using the format "\#FFFFFF", but
with the version I was using for OSGiLab this no longer worked and I had to
delete the pre-pending pound symbol.
I missed an opportunity to "show-off" my design in regards to this, since I had
made an adapter class for the ShapeRenderer. I could've just updated my setColor
method, instead of changing every caller.
